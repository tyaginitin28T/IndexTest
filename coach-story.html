How do I repair my Coach bag?

All of our bags are crafted to last. We know that things happen, though, and sometimes bags need repair. The good news is: we have our very own Coach Repair Workshop staffed by expert craftspeople who love your bags as much as you do.
So, don’t ditch it, repair it—it’s another small thing we can do to keep bags out of landfill and reduce our impact on the planet.

To submit your bag or accessory for repair:
Bring it to any Coach Retail store, or send your bag to our Coach Repair Workshop yourself via an insured, trackable service like UPS or FedEx to:

COACH
Attn: Repair/Customer Service
5901 West Side Avenue
North Bergen, NJ 07047
Please print and include our Repair Service Request Form https://coach.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/CoachRepairServiceRequestForm  along with your item.

For common questions about repairs you can do at home, watch our YouTube series with Debi the Restorer:
